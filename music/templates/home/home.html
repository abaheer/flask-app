<p>The realization of the market for downloadable music grew widespread with the development of Napster, a music and
    file
    sharing service created by Shawn Fanning that made a major impact on the Internet scene in 2000. Some services have
    tethered downloads, meaning that playing songs requires an active membership. Napster was founded as a pioneering
    peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing Internet service that emphasized sharing audio files, typically music, encoded in
    MP3
    format. The original company ran into legal difficulties over copyright infringement, ceased operations and was
    eventually acquired by Roxio. In its second incarnation Napster became an online music store until Rhapsody acquired
    it
    from Best Buy on December 1, 2011. Later companies and projects successfully followed its P2P file sharing
    example
    such as Gnutella, Freenet, Kazaa, Bearshare, and many others. Some services, like LimeWire, Scour, Grokster,
    Madster,
    and eDonkey2000, were brought down or changed due to similar circumstances.</p>

<br>

<p>The major record labels eventually decided to launch their own online stores, allowing them more direct control over
    costs and pricing and more control over the presentation and packaging of songs and albums. Sony Music
    Entertainment's
    service did not do as well as was hoped. Many consumers felt the service was difficult to navigate and use. Sony's
    pricing of US$3.50 per song track also discouraged many early adopters of the service. Furthermore, as MP3 Newswire
    pointed out in its review of the service, users were actually only renting the tracks for that $3.50, because the
    patron
    did not own the audio file. After a certain point the files expired and could not be played again without
    repurchase.
    The service quickly failed.</p>

<br>

<p>Undaunted, the record industry tried again. Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment teamed up with a
    service
    called Duet, later renamed pressplay. EMI, AOL/Time Warner and Bertelsmann Music Group teamed up with MusicNet.
    Again,
    both services struggled, hampered by high prices and heavy limitations on how downloaded files could be used once
    paid
    for. In the end, consumers chose instead to download music using illegal, free file sharing programs, which many
    consumers felt were more convenient and easier to use. </p>
